# Reactive Spring

## Description

<strong>Reactive Programming</strong>: This programming model is based on the concept of reactive streams, where data is processed asynchronously, and components react to changes or events in data. It uses non-blocking backpressure to control the flow of data.

**Spring WebFlux**: A key module in Reactive Spring, it is an alternative to Spring MVC for building reactive web applications. It supports both fully asynchronous, non-blocking request processing, and also serves as the entry point for building reactive RESTful web services.

**Reactor Project**: Reactor is a reactive library from the Spring team. It is the backbone of the reactive programming model in Spring and provides two main types:

Mono<T>: Represents a stream with 0 or 1 element.
Flux<T>: Represents a stream with 0 to N elements.
